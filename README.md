# Custom Car Loader (CCL)

Original project created by Freznosis is [here](https://github.com/Freznosis/DVCustomCarLoader)

A mod for Derail Valley that allows the creation of custom rolling stock & locomotives. The mod is still under development, thus bugs or idiosyncrasies are to be expected. You can use the car creation package to setup a car in Unity and export it as an assetbundle, which can then be loaded into Derail Valley and spawned in-game. The cars can be spawned with the Comms Radio using the standard Car Spawner menu.

## See the [Wiki](https://github.com/katycat5e/DVCustomCarLoader/wiki) for a guide to car creation
