# DVCustomCarLoader (Unfinished)

[Forked from Freznosis/DVCustomCarLoader]

A rudimentary custom car loader for Derail Valley. The mod is still under development, thus bugs or idiosyncrasies are to be expected. You can use the car creation package to setup a car in Unity and export it as an assetbundle, which can then be loaded into Derail Valley and spawned in-game. The cars can be spawned with the Comms Radio using the standard Car Spawner menu.

## See the [Wiki](https://github.com/katycat5e/DVCustomCarLoader/wiki) for a guide to car creation
