# DVCustomCarLoader (Unfinished)

[Forked from Freznosis/DVCustomCarLoader]

A rudimentary custom car loader for Derail Valley. The mod is still under development, and currently only supports custom rolling stock or "dummy" locomotives (loco simulations are not yet supported). You can use the car creation package to setup a car in Unity and export it as an assetbundle, which can then be loaded into Derail Valley and spawned in-game. The cars can be spawned with the Comms Radio using the new "Custom Car Spawner" menu.

## See the [Wiki](https://github.com/katycat5e/DVCustomCarLoader/wiki) for a guide to car creation
